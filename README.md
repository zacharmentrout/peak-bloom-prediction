# Instructions

To run the analysis and reproduce the predictions, open the R project file
`peak-bloom-prediction.Rproj`, then open and run `analysis.qmd`.

Note: renv will first install required packages and versions via the `restore`
function to ensure full reproducibility.

Predictions will be written to `cherry-predictions.csv`.

Further analysis is presented following the predictions block.
